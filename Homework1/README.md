**Feedback from Review 2**:

I have taken a look at your work and can see that you have taken most of the feedback into account and made appropriate changes which is great ! In part 2, the dropdowns are not being displayed on hover which is something you can work on.


Part 1:

- more semantic tags to Part 1
- added image figure captions

Part 2:

- refined the CSS styling of the sidebar, making it cleaner
- decrease sidebar width, take us less space of dashboard


**Feedback from Review 1**:

Part 1: One of the requirements of the assignment is to use semantic tags in your HTML document which you seem to have missed. Overall, this is good work ! Youâ€™ve made good use of grids and flexbox to position elements on the page and the website also looks like a real newspaper landing page which is great !

Part 2: The structure and the positioning of elements in the dashboard needs more work. The elements that display on hover are not aligned with the element above it. Need to decrease the width of the sidebar as it is occupying a lot of space on the screen and there is a lot of whitespace inside. The graphs and information have been displayed correctly which is good !
