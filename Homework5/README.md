# HW 5

1. An interesting challenge you encountered when implementing JWT algorithms. What was the issue and how did you solve it?  
I faced an interesting challenge when attempting to decode the JWT token. It was a challenge because I was not familiar with the JWT format. I had to do some research to understand the format and do the initial parsing.

2. What security risks/vulnerabilities/weaknesses, if any, are present in your implementation? How can they be exploited and what are some ways to fix them? Are there any tradeoffs if you implement any of the fixes?  
Overall, the security risk is not that high since I used the HMAC algorithm.
