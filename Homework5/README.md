# Homework 4: Howler

1. An interesting challenge you encountered when implementing JTW algorithms. What was the issue and how did you solve it?


2. What security risks/vulnerabilities/weaknesses, if any, are present in your implementation? How can they be exploited and what are some ways to fix them? Are there any tradeoffs if you implement any of the fixes?

Feedback:  

#2
```
I have tested your app and can login and logout successfully ! However, the reused pages have not been replaced with pages you have created on your own, and this is something you can work on.
```

- revision to hmac computation, fixing issue where logins would fail after the first login

#1
```
You have reused all of the code from the lecture assignment which is not what you're supposed to do. You should create your own webpages and make sure you mostly write your own javascript,html and css. A few part such as the token middleware can be used as reference and you can reuse code and make appropriate changes. The login button is also not working and the user gets redirected back to the login page which is something you need to work on. Please ask questions on discord or join office hours if you need help figuring out the homework !
