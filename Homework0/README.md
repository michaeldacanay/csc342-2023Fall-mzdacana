# Homework 0: Thoughts on Ungrading

## 1. What are your thoughts on the Ungrading practice as it applies in general to teaching and learning (not necessarily specifically to this class)?

I believe the practice of Ungrading is similar to the workplace. It is good training for striving to learn out of curiosity.

## 2. What are your thoughts on the way Ungrading will be applied to this class based on what has been explained by your instructor and what is described in the syllabus?

I approve its application to this class, as long as the expectations are clearly defined. I would appreciate having some "Extra ideas" suggestions for assignments that we could do if we finish the main task, and make it easier to say that we put in more effort for a higher grade. I guess my mind still drift naturally toward getting a higher grade.

## 3. On the scale from 1 to 5, how confident are you in that you can earn an A in this class (1 is lowest, 5 is highest)?
